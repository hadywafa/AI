# 🧠 Azure Custom Vision Service – Image Classification & Object Detection

## 📘 Official Definition

**Azure Custom Vision** is part of Azure Cognitive Services that allows you to build, deploy, and improve image classifiers using your own custom data. Unlike pre-trained models, you train it with your own labeled images to classify specific objects (Image Classification) or identify multiple objects within a single image (Object Detection).

## 🎯 What You Can Do with Custom Vision

| Feature                  | Purpose                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Image Classification** | Tag an image as belonging to one or more categories (e.g., "Hemlock" vs "Cherry").  |
| **Object Detection**     | Detect multiple objects within a single image and locate them using bounding boxes. |

## 🧬 How Custom Vision Works (Conceptually)

```mermaid

    A[Upload Labeled Images] --> B[Train the Model]
    B --> C[Adjust Weights & Biases Internally]
    C --> D[Create Training Iteration]
    D --> E[Publish Iteration to Endpoint]
    E --> F[Use Endpoint to Classify or Detect Objects in New Images]
```

- 🧠 A **model** is made of **weights and biases** connecting neurons.
- 🔁 Training updates those weights using algorithms like **backpropagation** to minimize **cost functions**.
- 🏷️ Each image must be **tagged accurately**. Bad tagging = corrupt model = AI hallucinations.
- 🧼 Clean + accurate + sufficient data is 🔑.

    Trained Model-->>Python SDK: Iteration ready!
    You->>Python SDK: Publish iteration
    Python SDK->>Azure Portal: Deploy iteration to prediction endpoint
    You->>Prediction Endpoint: Send new image
    Prediction Endpoint-->>You: Return tag + confidence
```

## 🖼️ Hands-on Example – Image Classification

🪴 Tags used: `Hemlock`, `Japanese Cherry`  
📁 Data: 10 images per tag

📌 Key endpoints:

- **Training endpoint**: Used to create and train models
- **Prediction endpoint**: Used to make predictions with trained models

### Example Use Case

> Upload multiple images of Hemlock and Japanese Cherry, train a model, and then classify a new image as either tag.

### Model Precision Metrics

| Metric        | Meaning                                                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Precision** | How often a predicted tag is correct                                |
| **Recall**    | Out of all correct tags, how many were predicted correctly          |
| **AP**        | Average Precision – combo of precision and recall across thresholds |

Example output after training:

- `Hemlock` → 99.99% confidence
- `Cherry` → 0.000003% confidence (basically none)

🧠 Fun Fact: AI never guarantees 100% certainty. It’s always **"inference"**, not prediction, and neural networks inherently allow some margin of error.

## 🔍 Object Detection (🗂️ Tags + 📦 Bounding Boxes)

📌 Use case: Detect **multiple objects in one image**, like both a `fork` and a `scissor`.

### Key Difference from Classification

- You must define **regions of interest** (bounding boxes) for each object inside the image.
- Images and corresponding box coordinates are used for training.

### Output Example

- 📷 New image with a fork
- Output → “Fork” detected with 81% confidence, bounding box shown

## 🧑‍💻 Python Tips & LLM Limitation

⚙️ Debugging SDK? Use the `function` variable in IDE to explore available methods if docs are unclear.

❗ At the time of writing:

> LLMs (even ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot) were **unable to generate working code for advanced Custom Vision SDK flows**. Manual exploration + documentation was still necessary.

## 🧼 Best Practices

- ✅ **Use clean, correctly tagged data**
- ✅ **Use similar images for better training**
- ✅ **Avoid ambiguous or mislabeled samples**
- ✅ **Tag each image with multiple relevant tags if needed**
- ✅ **Use Azure Vision Studio for visual inspection & debugging**
