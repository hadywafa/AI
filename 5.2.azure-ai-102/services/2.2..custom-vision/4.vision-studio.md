## 🎯 What is Azure AI Vision Studio?

> **Azure AI Vision Studio** is a **no-code**, browser-based interface that lets you explore, test, and build AI-powered solutions with the Azure **Computer Vision**, **Custom Vision**, **Face**, and **Form Recognizer** services.

It’s like the **Photoshop of AI**, but instead of applying filters, you're applying neural magic to extract information, detect objects, and classify images.

## 🧱 Vision Studio Features Overview

Here’s a high-level overview of what you can do inside:

### 🏷️ **Image Classification**

- Upload labeled images
- Train a model
- Test new images
- Export the model (TensorFlow, ONNX, CoreML, etc.)

### 🎯 **Object Detection**

- Draw bounding boxes
- Label multiple objects per image
- Train & evaluate
- Deploy + Test predictions

### 📸 **Image Analysis**

- Use prebuilt models to detect:

  - Tags (e.g., “tree”, “car”, “mountain”)
  - Captions
  - Adult/racy/gore content
  - Celebrities, landmarks
  - OCR (text recognition)

### 📝 **Form Recognizer (Document Intelligence)**

- Upload invoices, receipts, forms
- See key-value pairs extracted
- Train custom extractors

### 👁️ **Face Detection (Limited Access)**

- Detect face landmarks
- Emotion, pose, mask detection

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics You Can See

| Metric           | Where You See It 📊   | What It Tells You                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Precision        | Model performance tab | How accurate are predicted tags           |
| Recall           | Same                  | How well the model finds the correct tags |
| Confusion Matrix | Optional preview      | What’s getting misclassified              |
| Per-Tag Stats    | Table of every tag    | Micro/macro averages shown                |

---

## 📦 Model Export Options

After training in Vision Studio, you can export models to:

| Format               | Use Case                            |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **ONNX**             | Universal format for many platforms |
| **TensorFlow**       | Mobile & cloud apps                 |
| **CoreML**           | iOS apps                            |
| **Docker Container** | Easily deploy to servers            |

---

## 🔐 Pricing Note

Vision Studio itself is free, but:

- **Custom Vision projects** consume training & prediction credits
- **Prebuilt models (Image Analysis, OCR)** use API calls billed by tier

Make sure your Cognitive Services resource has **enough quota**.

## 📸 Sample Screenshot (Visual Reference)

> _Imagine uploading an image of a dog on a skateboard and Vision Studio tagging it as:_

- Dog 🐶
- Skateboard 🛹
- Outdoor 🌳
- Action 🏃‍♂️

> Then it gives you a **caption**:
> _“A dog riding a skateboard in the park”_ — 👏 Magic.
