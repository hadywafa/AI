# 🧠 Azure Custom Vision – Image Classification 👁️📦

## 🧭 What is Image Classification?

**Image Classification** is the process of identifying the **primary subject** of an image and categorizing it into **predefined classes** (aka _tags_ or _labels_).

It answers the question:

> _"What is in this image?"_

Azure's **Custom Vision** service allows you to **train your own image classifier** using your own labeled images — no PhD required!

---

## 🧪 Official Definition (Microsoft-style)

> **Custom Vision** is a cognitive service that lets you build, deploy, and improve your own image classifiers. You upload labeled images, train the model, evaluate its performance, and deploy it for prediction using REST APIs or SDKs.

## 🧱 Types of Classification in Custom Vision

| Type             | What it does                        | When to use it                                |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Single-label** | Assigns **one tag** per image       | If image contains **only one object**         |
| **Multi-label**  | Assigns **multiple tags** per image | If image can contain **more than one object** |

Example:

- 🐶 Single-label: "Dog"
- 🐶🍽️ Multi-label: "Dog", "Bowl", "Table"

## ⚙️ End-to-End Workflow (Humanized) 🧪

Here's how the **Custom Vision magic** happens:

## 🧰 Step-by-Step Implementation (Conceptual)

### Step 1: Create a Custom Vision Resource

- Requires:

  - **Training Resource**
  - **Prediction Resource**

- Use Azure Portal or ARM/Bicep.

> 🔐 You’ll get **2 endpoints** and **keys**:
>
> - Training Endpoint
> - Prediction Endpoint

---

### Step 2: Prepare & Upload Your Images 🖼️

- Images should:

  - Match real-world conditions.
  - Be **cleanly labeled**.
  - Avoid ambiguity (no mixing a cat and a toaster unless you're building a meme detector).

💡 Tags are your classes (e.g., "Cat", "Dog", "Mouse")

You can:

- Use **Python SDK**
- Or the **Custom Vision Portal UI** (drag-and-drop bliss 😇)

---

### Step 3: Train the Model 🧠

Using SDK or Portal, you click "Train".

💡 Under the hood:

- It adjusts **weights and biases** of a neural network.
- Using your **tagged image data**, it **minimizes error** via backpropagation.

You’ll receive a new **model iteration**.

---

### Step 4: Evaluate Performance 🔍

Custom Vision gives you:

| Metric                     | What it means                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Precision**              | % of predictions that were correct          |
| **Recall**                 | % of relevant results that were predicted   |
| **AP (Average Precision)** | Combines precision & recall over thresholds |

📈 Use these to decide whether to:

- Retrain with more data.
- Publish the model.

> 🧼 Garbage in, garbage out — clean and diverse data = happy model.

---

### Step 5: Publish the Model 🚀

Once satisfied with metrics:

```python
trainer.publish_iteration(project_id, iteration.id, "prod_model", prediction_resource_id)
```

This makes it available on the **Prediction Endpoint**.

---

### Step 6: Predict New Images 🔮

Use `CustomVisionPredictionClient` to classify new images:

```python
results = predictor.classify_image(project_id, "prod_model", open("test.jpg", "rb").read())
```

Each result contains:

- **Tag**
- **Probability**

🧪 Example output:

```json
{
  "tagName": "Cat",
  "probability": 0.98
}
```

---

## 🧑‍🏫 Best Practices for Classification

- ✅ Minimum 30 images per tag (more = better).
- ✅ Use varied backgrounds, angles, lighting.
- ✅ Balance your tag classes.
- ❌ Don’t reuse test images as training data.
- ✅ Validate using **confusion matrix** when possible.

## 🧪 Sample Scenarios (Exam-Focused)

| Scenario                                                                             | Task                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| User wants to detect whether an image contains a "Damaged Product" or "Good Product" | Use Single-label classification                            |
| Images can have multiple conditions: "Cracked", "Rust", "Dust"                       | Use Multi-label classification                             |
| Need real-time image classification in mobile app                                    | Use published model + Prediction endpoint with SDK or REST |

---

## 🧠 Model Management – Iterations

| Feature       | What it means                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Iteration** | A version of a model trained on specific data |
| **Publish**   | Exposes iteration via endpoint                |
| **Unpublish** | Hides the iteration                           |
| **Compare**   | View performance across iterations            |

---

## 🛡️ Security & Cost Considerations

- **Key rotation** and **role-based access control (RBAC)** for securing endpoints.
- **Training** consumes compute → consider costs for large datasets.
- **Free tier**: Good for trials, but limited to 2 projects.

## 📖 Learning & Testing Tips for AI-102

1. 💡 Learn the terms: _Training_, _Prediction_, _Iteration_, _Tag_, _Project_.
2. 🧪 Hands-on: Try it via Portal first, then with SDK.
3. 🧠 Understand **differences between Classification vs. Object Detection**.
4. ✅ Practice use cases: when to choose multi-label over single-label.
