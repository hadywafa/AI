## 🧪 Example 1: Simple Text Translation (REST API)

Translate “Hello, world” from English to Spanish using REST API.

### 🔐 Endpoint

```ini
POST https://api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com/translate?api-version=3.0&to=es
```

### 📨 Request Header

```http
Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <your-key>
Content-Type: application/json
```

### 📦 Request Body

```json
[{ "Text": "Hello, world" }]
```

### ✅ Response

```json
[
  {
    "translations": [{ "text": "Hola, mundo", "to": "es" }]
  }
]
```

---

## 🧪 Example 2: Language Detection

Let’s say you’re not sure what language the user typed. You can use:

```http
POST https://api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com/detect?api-version=3.0
```

```json
[{ "Text": "Bonjour tout le monde" }]
```

👉 Returns:

```json
[{ "language": "fr", "score": 1.0 }]
```

---

## 🗂️ Example 3: Document Translation (Word/PDF)

Upload `.docx` or `.pdf` to Azure Blob Storage, and Translator will:

1. Read the file
2. Translate it in the background
3. Save the translated version back to Blob Storage

This uses the [Document Translation SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/translator/document-translation/overview).

---

## 🧠 Customize with Glossary (Optional)

Want to make sure "GoDrive" always stays as "GoDrive" and not "IrConducir" in Spanish?

🧾 Use a **custom glossary** (TSV format):

| Source    | Target                 |
| --------- | ---------------------- |
| GoDrive   | GoDrive                |
| App Store | Tienda de Aplicaciones |

You can upload it and link it to your translations to preserve terminology!
