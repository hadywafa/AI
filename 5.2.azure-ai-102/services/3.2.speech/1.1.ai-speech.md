# 🗣️ Azure AI Speech Service – Full Breakdown for AI-102

> From raw voice to intelligent interaction, the Speech Service powers the future of AI conversations.

## 📘 What Is Azure AI Speech Service?

Azure AI Speech Service is a powerful cloud-based suite that allows apps to interact using **voice and audio**. It combines multiple capabilities:

| Feature                 | What it Does                                              |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Speech-to-Text**      | Converts spoken audio to written text                     |
| **Text-to-Speech**      | Converts text into natural-sounding audio                 |
| **Speech Translation**  | Translates spoken language into another spoken language   |
| **Speaker Recognition** | Identifies or verifies a person based on their voice      |
| **Custom Speech**       | Improves recognition for domain-specific terms or accents |

Think of this as a **Swiss Army knife** 🛠️ for everything voice-related!

## 🧪 Common Use Cases

| Scenario                       | Feature Used                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Real-time voice dictation      | Speech to Text                 |
| Accessibility in web apps      | Text to Speech                 |
| Voice-enabled language apps    | Speech Translation             |
| Voice biometric authentication | Speaker Recognition            |
| Domain-specific call center AI | Custom Speech + Speech to Text |

---

## 🛠️ Core Components Explained

### 🎙️ 1. **Speech-to-Text (STT)**

- Converts audio (live or pre-recorded) into text.
- Output includes:

  - Recognized text
  - Confidence score
  - Timestamps

**Use cases:** Live captioning, note dictation, command processing.

🧠 **Customization tip**: Use **Custom Speech** to train it with your own vocabulary.

---

### 🔊 2. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**

- Converts text to realistic voice output.
- Supports:

  - Multiple languages/accents
  - Styles (cheerful, serious, etc.)
  - Neural voices via SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language)

🎧 Example:

```ssml
<speak version='1.0' xml:lang='en-US'>
  <voice name='en-US-JennyNeural'>Hello! I'm a neural voice from Azure.</voice>
</speak>
```

---

### 🌐 3. **Speech Translation**

- Input: spoken language
- Output: written and spoken text in another language
- Ideal for **live meetings**, **language learning**, or **cross-border apps**

🌍 Example:

- Input: "Bonjour"
- Output: "Hello" (text + spoken)

---

### 🧑 4. **Speaker Recognition**

Two Modes:

| Mode               | Purpose                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Verification**   | "Is this person who they claim?" |
| **Identification** | "Who is speaking right now?"     |

Used for secure apps like:

- Voice login systems
- Personalized voice responses
- Audio classification

---

### 🛠️ 5. **Custom Speech**

- Tailor speech models to your **domain-specific vocabulary** (e.g., medical, legal, slang)
- Use cases:

  - Call centers
  - Internal company jargon
  - Regional accents

📦 Trained using:

- Audio recordings
- Transcripts
- Pronunciation rules

## 🧪 Hands-On (What You Should Know for the Exam)

For AI-102:

| Action                            | Exam Expectation                                    |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Create a Speech resource in Azure | Know where to find key + endpoint                   |
| Use Speech Studio                 | Know how to test features in browser                |
| Build client code                 | Understand high-level SDK flow                      |
| Understand pricing                | Know that neural voices and custom models cost more |
| Know speech region support        | Not all features are in all regions                 |

## 🧪 Sample Python SDK Snippet (Speech-to-Text)

```python
import azure.cognitiveservices.speech as speechsdk

speech_config = speechsdk.SpeechConfig(subscription="YourKey", region="YourRegion")
audio_config = speechsdk.AudioConfig(filename="example.wav")

speech_recognizer = speechsdk.SpeechRecognizer(speech_config=speech_config, audio_config=audio_config)

result = speech_recognizer.recognize_once()

if result.reason == speechsdk.ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech:
    print(f"Recognized: {result.text}")
else:
    print("No speech could be recognized")
```

🧠 But for the **exam**, don't focus on syntax—**know what is being done, and why**.
