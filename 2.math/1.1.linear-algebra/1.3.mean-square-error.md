# 📉 Mean Squared Error (MSE)

> _“How far are we from the truth — on average and squared?”_

## 🎯 What Are We Solving?

When you build a machine learning model (like predicting house prices 🏠), you want to know **how good or bad** your model is.

👉 To do that, you compare:

- What the **model predicted**
- What the **real answer** is

That’s where **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** comes in!

---

## 📘 Official Definition

**Mean Squared Error (MSE)** is a number that tells us **how far off our predictions are**, on average. It does this by:

1. Taking the difference between **real value** and **predicted value**
2. **Squaring** that difference (so it’s always positive)
3. **Averaging** all the squared differences

The formula is:

$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
$$

Where:

- $y_i$: actual (real) value for item $i$
- $\hat{y}_i$: predicted value for item $i$
- $n$: total number of items

## 🧠 Why Do We Use MSE?

| Reason 🧐                    | Explanation                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ✅ Square the error          | So positive & negative mistakes don’t cancel out                   |
| ✅ Bigger mistakes hurt more | Squaring makes large errors count more                             |
| ✅ Great for training models | MSE is smooth and easy to work with in math (especially calculus!) |

## 🧮 Easy Example

Let's say we want to predict the height of people.  
You have a model and you test it on 3 people:

```python
# Actual heights (in cm)
y_true = [170, 165, 180]

# Predicted by your model
y_pred = [168, 160, 175]
```

Let’s walk through calculating MSE 👇

---

## 🔁 Step-by-Step Breakdown

### Step 1: Find the error

For each person, subtract predicted from actual:

$$
\text{errors} = [170 - 168, 165 - 160, 180 - 175] = [2, 5, 5]
$$

---

### Step 2: Square the error

$$
[2^2, 5^2, 5^2] = [4, 25, 25]
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the mean (average)

$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{4 + 25 + 25}{3} = \frac{54}{3} = 18
$$

✅ So the **MSE** is **18**.

This means that **on average**, your model is off by a **squared error of 18 cm²**.

## 💻 Python Code for MSE

```python
y_true = [170, 165, 180]
y_pred = [168, 160, 175]

# Step 1: Calculate squared errors
squared_errors = [(yt - yp) ** 2 for yt, yp in zip(y_true, y_pred)]

# Step 2: Take the mean
mse = sum(squared_errors) / len(y_true)

print("MSE:", mse)  # Output: 18.0
```

## 📊 Visual Table

| Person | Actual ($y_i$) | Predicted ($\hat{y}_i$) | Error ($y_i - \hat{y}_i$) | Squared Error |
| ------ | -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------- |
| 1      | 170            | 168                     | 2                         | 4             |
| 2      | 165            | 160                     | 5                         | 25            |
| 3      | 180            | 175                     | 5                         | 25            |

## ⚖️ When to Use MSE?

MSE is great when:

- You want to **penalize big errors more**
- You are working on **regression problems**
- You want something **easy to optimize** with gradient descent

## 🆚 MSE vs Other Metrics

| Metric   | Formula                                | Use Case                           |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **MSE**  | $\frac{1}{n} \sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$ | Penalizes big errors more          |
| **MAE**  | $\frac{1}{n} \sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)$   | Less sensitive to outliers         |
| **RMSE** | $\sqrt{\text{MSE}}$                    | Puts error back into original unit |

## ✅ TL;DR

| Term      | Meaning                                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| MSE       | Mean of squared errors between prediction and truth |
| Lower MSE | Means better model                                  |
| MSE = 0   | Perfect prediction                                  |
