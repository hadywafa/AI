# üß† Azure Content Moderator Service (Text & Image)

## üéØ **Goal**

Understand what Azure Content Moderator is, why it‚Äôs used, and how it fits into the AI-102 certification context.

---

## üìù **What is Azure Content Moderator?**

Azure **Content Moderator** is a cloud-based AI service under **Azure Cognitive Services** that helps **automatically detect potentially offensive, sensitive, or unwanted content** in:

- üßæ **Text**
- üñºÔ∏è **Images**
- üéûÔ∏è **Videos** (via frame-by-frame image analysis)

It is a **REST-based API** that can also be accessed via SDKs (like Python, .NET, JavaScript).

> üí° **Use Case**: Automatically screen user-generated content in forums, chat apps, or upload portals.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Key Capabilities**

| Type      | Capability Description                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Text**  | Detects profanity, PII (like email/phone), autocorrects typos       |
| **Image** | Detects racy/adult content, finds faces, reads embedded text (OCR)  |
| **Video** | Frame-by-frame image moderation (similar to image moderation logic) |

> Note: **Video content moderation** is built on **image moderation**‚Äîvideos are simply a sequence of frames (images).

## üìà Why It Matters for AI-102

AI-102 focuses on **designing and integrating Azure AI solutions**. Content Moderator is a great example of a **pre-built AI model** for solving a **specific business problem** without requiring custom ML models.

It teaches:

- Using REST APIs with API keys
- Using SDKs to wrap REST APIs
- Structuring JSON input/output
- Handling real-world AI problems (moderation, compliance, automation)

## üîÅ Pattern: REST-Based Interaction

When you create a Content Moderator resource in Azure, you get:

- üåê A **REST endpoint URL** (e.g., `https://<your-region>.api.cognitive.microsoft.com`)
- üîë An **API Key** (used to authenticate requests)

Interaction model:

```ini
Client (your app)
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ> REST API (via endpoint + key)
         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ> Input: Text/Image
         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ> Output: JSON (moderation results)
```

> This is the same interaction pattern used in all Azure Cognitive Services.

## üßæ **How to Start Using It**

### 1. ‚òÅÔ∏è Create an Azure Account

- Go to: [https://azure.microsoft.com/free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free)
- \$200‚Äì\$300 in free credit for 30 days
- Requires valid card (no charge unless explicitly allowed)

### 2. ‚ûï Create a Resource

- Go to **Azure Portal**
- Create a **Content Moderator** instance under **Azure AI Services**
- Get your:

  - **Endpoint**
  - **Key 1 / Key 2** (both work)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Some services require **manual approval** (e.g., Face API). Not all are open by default.

---

## üß† Special Note: Obsolescence

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Azure Content Moderator is deprecated** as of February 2024 and will be **retired on March 15, 2027**. It is replaced by **Azure AI Content Safety**, which offers advanced AI features and enhanced performance.

However, understanding it is still critical for:

- Pattern recognition
- Comparing general-purpose vs. specialized AI
- Learning real-world API interaction

Newer services like **Azure AI Vision**, **Azure AI Language**, or **OpenAI moderation** may take over the capabilities.
