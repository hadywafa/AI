# 🧠 Azure Custom Vision Domains – Explained with Use Cases

Domains in Custom Vision define **how your model is trained and optimized**. Each domain is a set of pre-configured neural network settings and data preprocessing tailored for **different image types, environments, and deployment goals**.

---

## 🧩 Domain Categories Overview

There are **two major domain types**:

| Domain Type          | Used For                               |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Classification**   | Classify entire images into categories |
| **Object Detection** | Detect and localize multiple objects   |

Each has domain _variants_ based on your project’s content and environment.

## 🔍 1. Classification Domains

### ✅ General

- **Use Case**: Everyday object classification
- **Strength**: Great all-arounder
- **Example**: Classify images as "Cat", "Dog", or "Bird"
- **Exportable?** ❌ _Cannot export to edge devices_ (cloud-only)

### ✅ General (Compact)

- **Use Case**: Same as General, but designed for **edge** and **mobile**
- **Strength**: Smaller, optimized model
- **Example**: Object classification on Raspberry Pi or mobile app
- **Exportable?** ✅ Yes (ONNX, TensorFlow, CoreML)

### ✅ Food

- **Use Case**: Classify types of food
- **Strength**: Tuned for food image recognition
- **Example**: "Pizza" vs "Burger" vs "Sushi"
- **Exportable?** ❌ No (Cloud only)

### ✅ Retail

- **Use Case**: Product packaging or store items
- **Strength**: Recognizes logos, packaging layouts
- **Example**: Product brands, cereal boxes
- **Exportable?** ✅ Yes (Compact version available)

### ✅ Landmarks

- **Use Case**: Historical/cultural site recognition
- **Example**: "Eiffel Tower", "Statue of Liberty"
- **Exportable?** ❌ No

## 🧰 2. Object Detection Domains

### ✅ General (Object Detection)

- **Use Case**: Detect objects and draw bounding boxes
- **Example**: Detect “helmet” and “gloves” in safety image
- **Exportable?** ❌ No

### ✅ General (Compact)

- **Use Case**: Same, but for **disconnected edge devices**
- **Example**: Detect tools on an assembly line with no internet
- **Exportable?** ✅ Yes

### ✅ Retail (Compact)

- **Use Case**: Product box layout + object detection
- **Example**: Recognize objects in checkout or shelf
- **Exportable?** ✅ Yes

### ✅ Logo (Compact)

- **Use Case**: Detect logos in noisy images
- **Example**: Detect brand logos on shirts or posters
- **Exportable?** ✅ Yes

## 🧠 Why You Must Change to a **Compact Domain** for Edge Exports

❌ Problem => General domains (non-compact) are **too large** and **depend on cloud infrastructure**.  
✅ Solution => Compact domains are **optimized for offline edge scenarios** – small, lightweight, and portable.

---

### 🚫 Example Problem:

You train a model in **General (Classification)** to detect plant types. Now you want to deploy it on an IoT device in a remote farm with **no internet**.

👉 You'll get an error: ❌ _Export not supported for General domain_

### ✅ Solution:

- Switch to **General (Compact)** domain.
- Re-train using same tagged images.
- Export to **ONNX**, **TensorFlow Lite**, or **CoreML** depending on your target device.

## 📝 Real-World Mapping

| Scenario                             | Domain to Use         | Edge Export |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ----------- |
| Pet breed classifier on mobile       | **General (Compact)** | ✅          |
| Logo detector on advertising banners | **Logo (Compact)**    | ✅          |
| Grocery shelf scanner in store       | **Retail (Compact)**  | ✅          |
| French cheese recognizer (cloud)     | **Food**              | ❌          |
| Security cam object detector         | **General (Compact)** | ✅          |

## 📌 Summary: Why Domain Choice Matters

| 🔍 Decision Factor              | 💡 Domain Impact                         |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Want export for offline edge?   | Use **Compact** domain                   |
| Focused on food classification? | Use **Food** domain                      |
| Need bounding boxes?            | Choose **Object Detection** domain       |
| Want general, simple classifier | Use **General** or **General (Compact)** |

## 📘 Bonus Tip (AI-102 Exam):

> “A customer wants to deploy a Custom Vision model to an offline mobile app. The project uses General (Classification). What must they do?”

✔️ Correct answer: **Change the domain to General (Compact) and re-train**
