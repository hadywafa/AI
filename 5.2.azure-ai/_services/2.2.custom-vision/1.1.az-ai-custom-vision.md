# üëÅÔ∏è What Is Azure AI Custom Vision?

Azure Custom Vision is a cloud-based computer vision service that allows you to **train your own image classification and object detection models** without needing deep ML expertise. You upload labeled images, it learns patterns, then you can export the model to the cloud, edge device, or mobile app.

## üéØ What You Can Do with Custom Vision

| Feature                    | Purpose                                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`Image Classification`** | Tag an image as belonging to one or more categories (e.g., "Hemlock" vs "Cherry").  |
| **`Object Detection`**     | Detect multiple objects within a single image and locate them using bounding boxes. |

## üß© What Is a Domain?

A **domain** configures a training environment tailored to your scenario. It's about optimizing the model's performance.

- **Classification Domains**

  - `_General_`: For most object recognition/classification tasks.
  - `_Food_`: Tailored to recognize dishes or food items.
  - `_Retail_`: For product/**packaging** identification.
  - _`Custom Domains`_: Some models allow custom domains for specialized tuning.

- **Object Detection Domains**

  - Formats like `_Compact_`, `_General_`, `_Retail_`, `_Food_` for detecting objects within images.

üöÄ Choosing the right domain helps the training engine use the optimal architecture.

## üóÇ Project Lifecycle

Think of it as a **4-stage pipeline**, from data to deployment.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Setup

- Select project type: _Classification_ or _Object Detection_.
- Choose your domain and export target (e.g., _TensorFlow_, _ONNX_, _Edge_).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Image Tagging

- Upload images and **tag** them with either:

  - _Labels_ (classification)
  - _Bounding Boxes_ (detection)

- Ensure high-quality data: \~50+ images/label is a good baseline.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Training

- Press **Train**.

  - _Quick Training_ ‚âà 10‚Äì30 seconds.
  - _Advanced Training_ gives more performance but needs more time.

- Review performance metrics:

  - _Precision_, _Recall_, _mAP_ (for detection).
  - Refine data if needed: more images, better tags.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Testing & Iteration

- Test with new images to validate accuracy.
- Add misclassified images back to training data and **re-train**.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Export & Deploy

- Export model formats:

  - **TensorFlow**, **ONNX** ‚Äì for cloud or custom apps.
  - **Azure Container** ‚Äì deploy on AKS or edge devices.
  - **TinyML** ‚Äì for microcontrollers.

- Integrate via REST API or SDK.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Common Concepts & Tips

| Topic                   | What to Know                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ensemble Training**   | Some domains allow combining quick + advanced models for better outcomes.                                        |
| **Transfer Learning**   | Custom Vision uses transfer learning: starts from a pre-trained base and fine-tunes to your images.              |
| **Export Targets**      | Depends on domain; e.g., _Mobile (CoreML, TensorFlow Lite)_ for edge/mobile.                                     |
| **Performance Metrics** | Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall<br> Detection: Average Precision (AP), mean Average Precision (mAP). |
| **Iterative Approach**  | Always test, correct, re-train. High-quality labeled data beats quantity.                                        |

## üõ† **Example Workflow: Detecting Defective Parts**

1. **Project**: Object Detection ‚Üí Domain: _General (Compact)_ ‚Üí Export target: TensorFlow.
2. **Data Upload**: 500 images; tags: ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù ‚ÄúCrack,‚Äù ‚ÄúScratch.‚Äù
3. **Train**: Quick first, then advanced.
4. **Evaluate**: Achieve mAP ‚â•‚ÄØ0.8.
5. **Test**: Upload new images; adjust labels for missed/incorrect detection.
6. **Re-train**: Iterate.
7. **Export**: Use exported TensorFlow model in a factory-edge deployment.

## üìä Model Precision Metrics

| Metric          | Meaning                                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`Precision`** | How often a predicted tag is correct                                |
| **`Recall`**    | Out of all correct tags, how many were predicted correctly          |
| **`AP`**        | Average Precision ‚Äì combo of precision and recall across thresholds |

Example output after training:

- `Hemlock` ‚Üí 99.99% confidence
- `Cherry` ‚Üí 0.000003% confidence (basically none)

üß† Fun Fact: AI never guarantees 100% certainty. It‚Äôs always **"inference"**, not prediction, and neural networks inherently allow some margin of error.
