# 🧠 Azure AI Language – **Entity Components in Conversational Language Understanding (CLU)**

_A complete guide from basics to exam-ready examples – in your style._

## 🚀 What Are Entity Components?

In **Conversational Language Understanding (CLU)**, entities are pieces of information we want to extract from a user utterance, like:

- ✈️ "Cairo" → Destination
- 🕐 "2 PM" → Time
- 🎟️ "2 tickets" → TicketQuantity

Each **Entity** can include one or more **Components**, which define _how_ CLU will extract that entity.

## 🧩 The 4 Types of Entity Components

| 🧱 Component Type | 🔍 What it Does                                      | 🧠 Smart or Manual? | 📌 When to Use                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Learned**    | Learns from tagged training utterances using context | 🧠 Smart (ML-based) | When meaning depends on _context_                   |
| **2. List**       | Matches fixed values and synonyms you provide        | 🔤 Manual           | When you know the values (e.g. products, locations) |
| **3. Prebuilt**   | Recognizes common types (date, number, email, etc.)  | 🧠 Built-in         | For general entities like time, quantity, name      |
| **4. Regex**      | Matches using regular expressions (patterns)         | 🔣 Manual           | For structured values like invoice numbers, IDs     |

## 🔍 1. Learned Component

> Machine learning-based prediction using your tagged examples

### ✅ Best For:

- Understanding meaning based on **surrounding words**
- Role-based context (e.g. “Book **two** tickets” → “two” is TicketQuantity)

### 🧪 Example:

```txt
Utterance: “I want to buy 2 tickets to Cairo”
→ You tag “2” as the entity: TicketQuantity
→ CLU learns: numbers near 'tickets' = TicketQuantity
```

⚠️ Only available **if** you label training data.

---

## 📋 2. List Component

> Matches exact terms and synonyms from a predefined list

### ✅ Best For:

- Known terms (products, locations, companies)
- Mapping synonyms to a **normalized value**

### 🧪 Example:

```txt
List: ["New York", "London", "Dubai"]
Synonyms: "NYC" → "New York"
Utterance: "I want to fly to NYC"
→ Output: "New York"
```

✅ Supports **multiple languages** in multilingual projects

---

## 🏗️ 3. Prebuilt Component

> Built-in recognizers for common entities

### 🎁 Examples of Prebuilt Entities:

- DateTime
- Number
- Currency
- Email
- Location
- Organization

### 🧪 Example:

```txt
Utterance: “Book 3 tickets tomorrow”
→ Prebuilt.Number = “3”
→ Prebuilt.DateTime = “tomorrow”
```

⚠️ Max **5 prebuilt components** per entity

---

## 🔍 4. Regex Component

> Uses regular expressions to match patterns in the text

### ✅ Best For:

- ID formats (e.g. "ABC-12345")
- Invoice numbers, ZIP codes, codes

### 🧪 Example:

```txt
Regex: [A-Z]{3}-\d{5}
Utterance: “My order ID is ABC-12345”
→ Match: ABC-12345
```

✅ Supports language-specific expressions

---

## ⚠️ What If Multiple Components Detect the Same Thing?

When multiple components (e.g. learned + list) detect overlapping parts, you configure how CLU handles that.

---

## ⚖️ Entity Options – Control Overlap Behavior

### 🔗 Option 1: **Combine Components** _(Default and Recommended)_

→ CLU returns **merged result** with extra info from all components

🧪 Example:
List component detects: "Proseware OS"
Learned detects: "OS 9"
Utterance: "I want to buy Proseware OS 9"
✅ Output: `"Proseware OS 9"` (combined info)

---

### 🚫 Option 2: **Don’t Combine Components**

→ CLU returns each match **separately**

🧪 Example:
Utterance: "Proseware Desktop Pro"

- List: "Proseware Desktop"
- Learned: "Proseware Desktop Pro"
  ✅ Output: **two separate results**

Use this when you want **fine-grained control** or apply different logic per component.

---

## 🔒 Required Components – Forcing Strict Context

You can **mark a component as required**, so that entity is only returned if that component is matched.

### ✅ Useful when:

- You want to ensure prediction is **context-aware**
- Avoiding false positives from list/prebuilt

🧪 Example:
Entity: `TicketQuantity`

- Components:

  - Prebuilt.Number (finds any number)
  - Learned (trained on ticket-related numbers)

🔐 You mark **Learned as required**
→ Result will only include TicketQuantity if the **number is near 'tickets'**

## 🧠 Pro Tips for Entity Strategy

| 🎯 Goal                            | ✅ Use This              |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Match known values only            | List                     |
| Match known + unknown contextually | List + Learned (combine) |
| Match date/time/number             | Prebuilt                 |
| Match formatted patterns           | Regex                    |
| Restrict to specific meaning       | Use Required components  |

## 📝 Example for Exam Scenario

> 💬 "Book two tickets tomorrow to Cairo at 3 PM"

You want:

- `"two"` → TicketQuantity
- `"Cairo"` → Destination
- `"3 PM"` → Time

| Entity         | Components                                      |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| TicketQuantity | Prebuilt.Number + Learned (learned is required) |
| Destination    | List                                            |
| Time           | Prebuilt.DateTime                               |

## ✅ Summary Table

| Component    | Purpose                     | Smart? | Needs Training? |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ------ | --------------- |
| **Learned**  | Contextual prediction       | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes          |
| **List**     | Exact match from dictionary | ❌ No  | ❌ No           |
| **Prebuilt** | Recognizes standard types   | ✅ Yes | ❌ No           |
| **Regex**    | Pattern matching            | ❌ No  | ❌ No           |
