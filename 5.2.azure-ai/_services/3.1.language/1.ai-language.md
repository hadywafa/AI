# 🧠🗣️ **Azure AI Language Service**

> “The Language of machines is numbers. The language of people is messy. Azure AI Language Service helps bridge that gap.”

## 📌 What is Azure AI Language Service?

**Azure AI Language** is a cloud-based **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** service that uses pre-trained **AI models** to help applications understand and process human language. It allows you to perform language tasks like:

- Text analysis (sentiment, key phrases, language detection, etc.)
- Entity recognition (named and linked)
- Personal data redaction (PII detection)
- Summarization and classification
- Conversational analysis
- Custom classification and entity extraction

📦 It’s a unified service that evolved from individual Cognitive Services like Text Analytics, LUIS, and QnA Maker.

## 🛠️ Deployment Models

Azure AI Language supports two modes:

| Mode           | Description                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`Prebuilt`** | No training needed. Use APIs directly. Example: sentiment analysis. |
| **`Custom`**   | Train your own models using Azure Language Studio and labeled data. |

---

## 🧪 Example: Sentiment Analysis (Python SDK)

```python
from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

endpoint = "<your-language-endpoint>"
key = "<your-language-key>"

client = TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint=endpoint, credential=AzureKeyCredential(key))

documents = ["The food was amazing, but the service was slow."]
response = client.analyze_sentiment(documents=documents)[0]

print("Overall sentiment:", response.sentiment)
for sentence in response.sentences:
    print(f"→ '{sentence.text}' - {sentence.sentiment}")
```

🧠 Output:

```ini
Overall sentiment: mixed
→ 'The food was amazing,' - positive
→ 'but the service was slow.' - negative
```

## 🧱 REST API vs SDK vs Studio – What to Use?

| Tool           | Best For                                     |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **REST API**   | Universal access from any platform           |
| **Python SDK** | Clean integration with apps and ML workflows |
| **Studio**     | Non-developers or quick prototyping          |

---

## 💸 Pricing Summary

| Tier             | Included Features          | Best For             |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Free (F0)**    | Limited transactions       | Development, testing |
| **Standard (S)** | Pay per 1,000 text records | Production apps      |

You pay per **text record** processed. 1 record = 1,000 characters of input.

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- 🚀 Preprocess data (remove noise, emojis, etc.) before sending
- 🔤 Break long documents into smaller text blocks
- 🧪 Evaluate model outputs with labeled samples
- 📦 Use **custom models** when prebuilt doesn't fit your domain
- 🔒 Use private endpoints + CMK for regulated environments
