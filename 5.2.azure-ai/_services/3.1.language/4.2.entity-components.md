# 🧠 Azure AI Language – **Entity Components in Conversational Language Understanding (CLU)**

_A complete guide from fundamentals to exam-mastery. Includes examples, patterns, and real usage advice._

## 🚀 What Are Entity Components?

In **Conversational Language Understanding (CLU)**, entities are the pieces of structured data we want to extract from a user's utterance — like pulling useful info from a sentence.

### 🗣️ Example:

> Utterance: `"Book 2 tickets to Cairo at 2 PM"`
> CLU should extract:

- 🎯 `Intent: BookFlight`
- 📦 `Entities:`

  - `"2"` → `TicketQuantity`
  - `"Cairo"` → `Destination`
  - `"2 PM"` → `Time`

But **how** does it know what’s a time or place?
➡️ That’s where **Entity Components** come in!

## 🧩 The 4 Entity Component Types

| 🔢 Type      | 🤖 What It Does                                             | 🧠 Intelligence | 📌 Use When...                                          |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Learned**  | Uses ML to understand context and position in text          | ✅ Smart        | You want contextual meaning (e.g. "2" = TicketQuantity) |
| **List**     | Matches exact values or synonyms you define                 | ❌ Manual       | Known inputs (cities, products, brands, options)        |
| **Prebuilt** | Built-in recognizers like Date, Time, Currency, Email, etc. | ✅ Smart        | Recognizing universal formats (numbers, dates, etc.)    |
| **Regex**    | Uses pattern matching (like ZIPs or IDs)                    | ❌ Manual       | Input has a consistent format (e.g. "ORD-98212")        |

---

## 🔍 1. Learned Component

> Machine Learning-powered recognition, trained using labeled utterances

### ✅ Best For:

- Extracting values **based on sentence context**
- Roles like `TicketQuantity`, `DepartureCity`, `UserName`, etc.

### 🧪 Example:

> `"I want to book 2 tickets for Cairo"`
> ➡️ “2” is only meaningful **because** it's near “tickets”.

```text
→ Trained output: TicketQuantity = 2
```

✅ Handles plural, position, synonyms, and variations.

⚠️ **Must be trained** using labeled examples in Language Studio or via SDK.

---

## 📋 2. List Component

> You define the list of values and optional synonyms → CLU matches them directly

### ✅ Best For:

- Known lists: Cities, Products, Airport Codes, etc.
- Synonym normalization (e.g. “NYC” → “New York”)

### 🧪 Example:

```json
"List": ["New York", "London", "Dubai"]
"Synonyms": { "NYC": "New York", "LON": "London" }
Utterance: "I want to fly to NYC"
→ Destination = "New York"
```

✅ No training needed
✅ Works great in multilingual scenarios

---

## 🏗️ 3. Prebuilt Component

> Azure provides these out-of-the-box so you don’t reinvent the wheel

### 🎁 Prebuilt Options Include:

- `DateTime`
- `Number`
- `Email`
- `PhoneNumber`
- `Currency`
- `Location` _(basic)_

### 🧪 Example:

> `"I want 3 tickets tomorrow"`
> → CLU detects:

```json
"Prebuilt.Number": "3"
"Prebuilt.DateTime": "tomorrow"
```

⚠️ **Limit:** Only 5 Prebuilt components per entity
⛔ You can't customize how Prebuilts behave — they’re static.

---

## 🧠 4. Regex Component

> Pattern-based recognition using regular expressions

### ✅ Best For:

- Fixed formats like invoice numbers, user IDs, order codes

### 🧪 Example:

Regex pattern:

```regex
[A-Z]{3}-\d{5}
```

> Utterance: `"My order ID is ORD-98212"`
> → CLU extracts: `ORD-98212`

✅ Works across languages and can be used to ensure **strict validation**.

---

## ⚔️ Conflict: What If Multiple Components Match?

Imagine both your List and Learned components pick up the same word. You now have two options:

---

## ⚖️ Entity Overlap Behavior

### 🔗 1. Combine Components _(default, smart)_

> CLU merges info from all matching components into **one entity result**.

🧪 Example:

> Utterance: `"I want to buy Proseware OS 9"`

- List detects: `Proseware OS`
- Learned detects: `OS 9`

✅ Final output:

```json
{
  "Product": "Proseware OS 9"
}
```

✅ Keeps meaning richer & more flexible

---

### 🚫 2. Don’t Combine Components

> CLU returns each match separately.

🧪 Example:

> Utterance: `"Proseware Desktop Pro"`

- List detects: `Proseware Desktop`
- Learned detects: `Proseware Desktop Pro`

❗ Output:

```json
["Proseware Desktop", "Proseware Desktop Pro"]
```

✅ Great when you want different downstream logic per component match.

---

## 🔐 Required Components

> You can mark a component as **required** so that CLU **only returns the entity** when that component matches.

### ✅ Best For:

- Enforcing **strict context**
- Avoiding false matches by Prebuilt/List

🧪 Example:

Entity: `TicketQuantity`
Components:

- Prebuilt.Number
- Learned (trained on “2 tickets”, “I need 4”, etc.)

🔒 You mark **Learned** as required.

➡️ `"I want 4"` → ❌ Not enough
➡️ `"I want 4 tickets"` → ✅ Match

## 📌 Entity Strategy Cheat Sheet

| 🧠 Goal                              | ✅ Use This                 |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Fixed options like product names     | List                        |
| Extract based on sentence position   | Learned                     |
| Detect dates, numbers, currency      | Prebuilt                    |
| Validate fixed format like "ORD-123" | Regex                       |
| Filter out generic matches           | Use `Required` with Learned |
| Mix smart + fixed matching           | Combine List + Learned      |
