# 🎛️ Azure OpenAI Fine-Tuning: Task Parameters

These parameters control **how your model learns** from your training data during fine-tuning. Let’s break each one down with examples and real-life analogies:

---

## 🧱 1. **Batch Size**

| Option  | Meaning                                              |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Default | Uses a smart default (0.2% of total rows)            |
| Custom  | You choose how many samples the model sees in one go |

### 💡 What is it?

Batch size = How many examples the model looks at _at once_ during training.

### 🧠 Analogy:

Imagine you’re teaching a class. Do you teach:

- **1 student at a time** (very slow)
- **All students at once** (overwhelming)
- **Small groups** (balanced — this is batch size!)

### 📌 When to customize:

- If you have a very **small dataset**, use **small batch** (like 1–5)
- For **large datasets**, a higher batch size may speed up training

## 🎯 2. **Learning Rate Multiplier**

| Option  | Meaning                                        |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Default | A safe, moderate speed of learning             |
| Custom  | You control how fast the model learns new info |

### 💡 What is it?

Learning rate = How much the model changes itself (its “memory”) after each training round.

### 🧠 Analogy:

- A **high learning rate** is like cramming: fast but risky — you might forget other stuff.
- A **low learning rate** is like slow careful studying — more stable, but takes longer.

### 📌 When to customize:

- Use **lower rate** if the model keeps forgetting things or giving bad answers
- Use **higher rate** if training is super slow and you trust your data

## 🔁 3. **Number of Epochs**

| Option  | Meaning                                                            |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Default | Learns the training data once or twice (depending on dataset size) |
| Custom  | You control how many times the model studies the same data         |

### 💡 What is it?

Epoch = One full pass through **all** your training data.

### 🧠 Analogy:

Like **re-watching a training video**. The more times you watch, the more you remember.

### 📌 Best Practice:

- Small dataset? Use **3–10 epochs**
- Large dataset? **1–2 is often enough**
- You want the model to “memorize”? Increase epochs

## 🎲 4. **Seed**

| Option | Meaning                                                        |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Random | The model starts from a random state each time (unpredictable) |
| Custom | You set a number to make results repeatable                    |

### 💡 What is it?

A **seed** is like setting a fixed starting point for randomness. It makes training repeatable.

### 🧠 Analogy:

Like baking cookies with random toppings. If you set the seed, you get the **same batch** each time.

### 📌 When to customize:

- For **experiments** where you want repeatable results
- For **debugging** or comparing performance

## 🧠 Summary Table

| Parameter        | Controls...                       | Default is good? | Customize when…                      |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Batch Size       | Training speed vs. stability      | ✅ Yes           | You have very small or large dataset |
| Learning Rate    | How fast the model learns         | ✅ Yes           | Model is over/under-learning         |
| Number of Epochs | How many times to learn your data | ✅ Yes           | Model isn’t learning enough          |
| Seed             | Randomness in training            | ✅ Yes           | You want repeatable behavior         |
