# 🏛️ Azure Computer Vision – Landmark Detection (Demo)

This Python script uses the **`analyze_image_by_domain()`** API from the Azure Computer Vision service to detect **famous landmarks** in a list of remote image URLs.

---

## 📦 Required Setup

- Install the SDKs:

  ```bash
  pip install azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision python-dotenv
  ```

- Set environment variables in a `.env` file:

  ```ini
  AZURE_VISION_ENDPOINT=<your_endpoint>
  AZURE_VISION_KEY=<your_key>
  ```

---

## 🔍 What the Script Does

1. ✅ Loads credentials and connects to **ComputerVisionClient**
2. ✅ Uses a **pre-trained "landmarks" domain model** from Azure to identify landmarks from online images
3. ✅ Loops through multiple image URLs and prints any landmarks it detects

---

## 🔁 Example Flow

### Sample Image: 🏗️ Tower Bridge

```python
image_url = "https://...tower-bridge.jpg"
result = computervision_client.analyze_image_by_domain("landmarks", image_url)
```

### Sample Output:

```text
###### Computer Vision - Domain specific content - Landmarks #######
Landmarks in the remote image:
Tower Bridge
```

If no landmark is found:

```text
No landmarks detected.
```

---

## 📌 Notes

- Domain `"landmarks"` is passed to Azure to activate **specialized model** for landmark recognition.
- Works best with **famous** structures (e.g., Eiffel Tower, Taj Mahal, Tower Bridge).
- The model uses internal knowledge (not your image content) to match global landmarks.

---

## 🧠 Use Cases

- Tourism apps showing details about famous sites 🗺️
- Auto-captioning photo galleries
- Educational tools recognizing historical monuments

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python landmark_detection_demo.py
```

Replace or add more image URLs in the `IMAGES` list to try different landmarks.
