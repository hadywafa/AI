# 🖼️ Azure Computer Vision – Describe and Tag Image (Demo)

This demo uses Azure Vision API to:

- 📝 **Describe** the image in natural language (caption)
- 🏷️ **Tag** the image with keywords (objects/concepts)

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Make sure you install and configure your environment:

```bash
pip install azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision python-dotenv
```

`.env`:

```env
AZURE_VISION_ENDPOINT=<your_endpoint>
AZURE_VISION_KEY=<your_key>
```

---

## 🌍 Image Used

We use a **remote NASA simulation image**:

```python
remote_image_url = "https://universe.nasa.gov/.../BH_AccretionDisk_Sim_Stationary_1080.jpeg"
```

This is a simulation of a **black hole accretion disk**.

---

## 📸 What It Does

1. **Describes the image** with a caption
2. **Tags** the image with relevant concepts

---

## 🧠 Description (Natural Language)

```python
description_results = computervision_client.describe_image(remote_image_url)
```

It uses a **deep vision model** to generate human-like image captions.

### Sample Output:

```text
'a glowing ring of light around a dark center' with confidence 93.5%
```

---

## 🏷️ Tags (Keywords)

```python
tags_result_remote = computervision_client.tag_image(remote_image_url)
```

Azure Vision detects **relevant tags** like:

```text
'galaxy' with confidence 99.1%
'space' with confidence 97.2%
'black hole' with confidence 91.3%
```

These tags are useful for:

- Image search
- Cataloging
- Content filtering

---

## ✅ Use Cases

- Automatic image labeling for search engines 🔍
- Social media image tagging 📸
- Descriptive captions for visually impaired users ♿

---

## 🚀 Run It

Just run your script:

```bash
python describe_tag_image_demo.py
```
