# 📸 Azure AI Vision - Image Analysis (Demo Example)

This Python script shows how to use **Azure AI Vision SDK** to analyze an image from a URL using multiple built-in capabilities like tagging, captioning, OCR, smart cropping, and object/person detection.

---

## 🔧 Setup Requirements

- Install SDK:

  ```ini
  pip install azure-ai-vision azure-core python-dotenv
  ```

- Store your credentials in a `.env` file:

  ```ini
  AZURE_VISION_ENDPOINT=<your_endpoint>
  AZURE_VISION_KEY=<your_key>
  ```

---

## ✅ What the Script Does

### 🔐 1. **Connects to Azure Vision**

Uses `ImageAnalysisClient` with your credentials to access the service.

### 🌐 2. **Analyzes Image from URL**

It sends a public image URL (you can replace it) and requests a set of **visual features**:

```python
visual_features = [
    VisualFeatures.TAGS,
    VisualFeatures.OBJECTS,
    VisualFeatures.CAPTION,
    VisualFeatures.DENSE_CAPTIONS,
    VisualFeatures.READ,
    VisualFeatures.SMART_CROPS,
    VisualFeatures.PEOPLE,
]
```

These features include:

- **Captioning** (short sentence that describes the image)
- **Dense Captions** (captions for different parts of the image)
- **Tags** (keywords detected like ‘car’, ‘dog’)
- **Objects** (bounding boxes + labels)
- **People** (human detection)
- **OCR (Read)** (text from image)
- **Smart Crops** (crop suggestions based on content)

## 📤 Output Example

```text
📝 Caption:
   → 'A dog lying on a couch' (Confidence: 0.93)

📖 Read:
   Line: 'Welcome!' at [(x,y)...]
   Word: 'Welcome' (Confidence: 0.98)

🏷️ Tags:
   → 'dog' (Confidence: 0.97)
   → 'couch' (Confidence: 0.94)

📦 Objects:
   → 'dog' at BoundingBox(x, y, w, h)

🧑 People:
   → BoundingBox(...) (Confidence: 0.87)

📐 Smart Crops:
   → Aspect Ratio 0.9 → Crop Area (x, y, w, h)
```

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python image_analysis_demo.py
```

Make sure your image URL is valid and accessible publicly.
