# ü§ñ Microsoft Bot Framework SDK

## üåü What is the Microsoft Bot Framework?

The **Microsoft Bot Framework** is a complete platform for building **conversational AI experiences** (aka bots). It helps developers create bots that can interact with users via multiple channels (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Web Chat, Facebook Messenger, etc.).

üëâ The SDK part of the framework gives you all the tools to:

- Manage conversation flow
- Handle user input
- Integrate with language services like LUIS (now part of Azure AI Language)
- Connect to APIs, databases, and external services

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Components of the Bot Framework SDK

### 1. **Bot Builder SDK**

- Available in **C#** and **Node.js**
- Provides classes like `TurnContext`, `Activity`, `Dialog`, etc.
- Handles **conversation state**, **dialogues**, and **channel communication**

### 2. **Bot Adapter**

- Acts as a **bridge between your bot and a communication channel**
- Processes incoming activities (like user messages) and sends back responses

### 3. **Activity Object**

- Every message, event, or system interaction is an `Activity`
- Types include:

  - `message` (user sends text)
  - `conversationUpdate` (user joins a conversation)
  - `typing` (user is typing)

### 4. **Dialog System**

- Modular flow logic system (like steps in a conversation)
- Built-in types:

  - `WaterfallDialog` ‚Äì sequence of steps
  - `ComponentDialog` ‚Äì group of related dialogs
  - `AdaptiveDialog` (advanced, for complex logic)

## üß† Example Bot Flow (Waterfall Dialog)

```python
# Node.js example using waterfall dialogs
const { WaterfallDialog, ComponentDialog, TextPrompt } = require('botbuilder-dialogs');

this.addDialog(new WaterfallDialog('mainDialog', [
    async (step) => {
        return await step.prompt('TextPrompt', 'What‚Äôs your name?');
    },
    async (step) => {
        step.values.name = step.result;
        return await step.prompt('TextPrompt', `Hi ${step.result}, what do you need help with?`);
    },
    async (step) => {
        return await step.endDialog(`Thanks ${step.values.name}, we‚Äôll help with: ${step.result}`);
    }
]));
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Integration with Azure AI Services

Many AI-102 questions involve using **Bot Framework with Azure AI Language**, especially:

| Feature            | Integration Method                                    |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Intent Recognition | Connect with Azure CLU or LUIS                        |
| Q\&A Bot           | Use with Azure AI Language QnA                        |
| Sentiment Analysis | Use Azure AI Language ‚Üí Sentiment API in the flow     |
| Translator         | Combine with Azure AI Translator to support languages |
| Speech Input       | Combine with Azure AI Speech + Direct Line Speech     |

## üß™ Channels and Deployment Options

Bots can be connected to channels like:

- Microsoft Teams
- Web Chat
- Telegram
- Direct Line (custom apps)
- Facebook Messenger

**Deployment targets:**

- Azure Bot Service
- App Service (Web App)
- Containers (Docker)
- Local for dev/testing

---

## üîê Authentication and User Identity

- Use **OAuthPrompt** to connect bots to identity providers (Microsoft, Google, etc.)
- Ideal for enterprise bots using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)

---

## ‚úÖ TL;DR ‚Äì What You Need to Know

- **Bot Framework SDK** = Toolset to build intelligent, multi-channel bots
- Supports **dialog-based** and **event-driven** conversations
- Plays well with **Azure AI Language**, **Azure Cognitive Services**, and **Teams**
- **Bot deployment and channel configuration** often tested in AI-102 scenarios
- Learn to distinguish between **Bot SDK** (code-level) and **Bot Service** (Azure-hosted)
