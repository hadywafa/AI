# 🧱 Types of [Dialogs library](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-concept-dialog?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) in Microsoft Bot Framework SDK

## 🎬 What is a Dialog?

A **dialog** in Bot Framework SDK is a **modular component** that manages a conversation flow — like asking a series of questions, tracking progress, and guiding the user to a goal (e.g., booking, ordering, searching).

Think of it like:

> 🗣️ "Ask question → Wait for reply → Process → Ask next question…"

There are **multiple dialog types**, each designed for different conversational patterns.

## 1️⃣ **Waterfall Dialog** – Step-by-Step Flow

### 📌 Description:

Executes steps **sequentially**, like a waterfall.
Each step runs → waits for user input → continues to the next.

### 🛠️ Use Case:

Perfect for **multi-turn conversations**, such as:

- Booking tickets
- Asking for user details
- Onboarding flows

### 🧠 Sample Steps:

1. "What's your name?"
2. "Where do you want to go?"
3. "What date do you prefer?"

### 🧪 Exam Scenario:

**Q:** Which dialog structure is ideal for guiding a user through a multi-step form?
→ ✅ _WaterfallDialog_

---

## 2️⃣ **Prompt Dialogs** – Built-in Question Types

### 📌 Description:

Built-in dialogs to ask for **specific kinds of user input**.

### 🛠️ Types:

| Prompt Type    | Example                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| TextPrompt     | "What's your name?"          |
| NumberPrompt   | "How many tickets?"          |
| ConfirmPrompt  | "Are you sure? (yes/no)"     |
| ChoicePrompt   | "Pick one: Red, Blue, Green" |
| DateTimePrompt | "When do you want to go?"    |

### 🧪 Exam Scenario:

**Q:** Which dialog is best to get the user to select from a list?
→ ✅ _ChoicePrompt_

---

## 3️⃣ **Adaptive Dialog (Advanced)** – Reactive & Rule-Based

### 📌 Description:

A **dynamic dialog** that reacts to user input using **triggers, conditions, and rules**, not just linear steps.

### 🧠 Think of it as:

> "If the user says X → run action Y"

### 🛠️ Use Case:

- Highly dynamic bots with unpredictable input
- Complex workflows like helpdesk bots

### 🧪 Exam Scenario:

**Q:** Which dialog type allows for rule-based branching and dynamic behaviors?
→ ✅ _AdaptiveDialog_

### ⚠️ Note:

Adaptive Dialogs are part of **Bot Framework Composer** (visual designer) and **not fully integrated** into traditional SDK-based bots unless explicitly added.

---

## 4️⃣ **Component Dialog** – Dialog Container

### 📌 Description:

A **wrapper dialog** that contains other dialogs inside (Waterfall, Prompt, etc.).
Lets you **encapsulate and reuse logic**.

### 🛠️ Use Case:

- Modularize logic (e.g., `AuthenticationDialog`, `SearchDialog`)
- Compose dialogs into larger flows

### 📦 Example:

A `BookFlightDialog` that includes:

- `CollectDestinationStep`
- `CollectDateStep`
- `ConfirmBookingStep`

### 🧪 Exam Scenario:

**Q:** You want to reuse a sub-dialog in multiple places. What dialog should you use?
→ ✅ _ComponentDialog_

---

## 5️⃣ **DialogSet & DialogContext** – Managing Dialogs in Memory

### 📌 Description:

These are **helper classes** used internally to manage dialog stacks and state.
You rarely use them directly in simple bots, but they're used under the hood.

---

## 🤔 How Dialogs Work Together

Dialogs can **call each other** and **return values**, just like functions:

- `MainDialog` → calls `BookingDialog` → which uses `WaterfallDialog` + `Prompt`

This allows you to **build large, scalable bots** with clean logic separation.

## ✅ Summary Table

| Dialog Type       | Purpose                        | Use Case Example               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| WaterfallDialog   | Step-by-step conversation      | Booking form, data gathering   |
| ComponentDialog   | Reusable dialog grouping       | Auth dialog, nested flows      |
| PromptDialogs     | Ask for user input             | Text, number, choice, confirm  |
| AdaptiveDialog    | Dynamic, condition-based flow  | Helpdesk bot, FAQs, smart bots |
| DialogSet/Context | Infra tools for managing stack | Behind the scenes              |

## 🧠 Final Exam Tips

- **WaterfallDialog** is the most common pattern used for multi-step logic.
- Use **PromptDialogs** when you need structured input.
- **ComponentDialog** is for grouping and reusing logic — especially subdialogs.
- Know that **AdaptiveDialog** is more flexible but complex — and appears in Composer-heavy solutions.
- Understand **which dialog type is best** for a scenario, not just syntax.
