**‚úÖ The answer:**
`1. https://centralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com`
`2. /text/analytics/v3.1/languages`

---

**ü§î Why This Is the Best Answer:**

- `https://centralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com`: This is a valid **base endpoint** for Azure Cognitive Services in the **Central US region**, commonly used for services like Text Analytics (Language Detection).
- `/text/analytics/v3.1/languages`: This is the correct **API path** for detecting the language of a given input using the **Azure AI Language** service. It helps you determine whether a customer query is in English or Spanish so you can route it accordingly.

---

**‚ùå Why Other Options Are Wrong:**

- `https://eu.api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com`: While valid for Translator, it doesn't relate to **language detection**; it's just a **regional base URL**.
- `/translator/text/v3.0/translate?to=es` and `/translate?to=en`: These are **translation endpoints**, not for detecting language. Translation is **not required** in this use case since the goal is routing based on **original message language**, not converting it.
- `https://portal.azure.com`: This is just the **web portal**, not an API endpoint. It cannot be used in code to detect or translate language.
