# 🧾 Azure AI Document Intelligence

Many forms and documents that businesses handle are common across disparate companies in different sectors. For example, most companies use invoices and receipts. Microsoft Azure AI Document Intelligence includes prebuilt models so you can handle common document types easily.

## 📦 What Are Prebuilt Models?

Prebuilt models in Azure AI Document Intelligence enable you to extract data from common forms and documents without training your own models.

they can be:

1. General-Purpose Models (for unpredictable document structures)
2. Specialized Prebuilt Models (for known document types)

## 📌 I. General-Purpose Models (for unpredictable document structures)

These are perfect when documents don't follow a fixed format – like contracts, specs, or tenders.

---

### 👀 **1. Read Model**

- 📌 Extracts **printed and handwritten text**.
- 🈲 Detects **language per line** (supports more for printed).
- ✍️ Identifies if text is **handwritten or printed**.
- 📑 Use `pages` parameter to analyze specific pages in PDFs/TIFFs.
- 📦 Used internally by all other models.

🧠 **Example**: Scanning messy handwritten notes or mixed-language brochures and extracting clean text.

---

### 📋 **2. Layout Model**

- 🧾 Extracts **tables** and **selection marks** in addition to text.
- 📐 Returns detailed structure: cell size, position, headers, row/col index.
- ☑️ Detects checkboxes (selected/unselected) with confidence score.

🧠 **Example**: Digitizing multi-format surveys or forms with tables and checkmarks.

### 🎯 **3. General Document Model**

- 💬 it can Extracts:

  - Key-value pairs
  - Tables
  - Selection marks
  - **Entities** (unique to this model!)

- 📊 Works on structured, semi-structured, and unstructured docs.
- 🧾 Supports **entity detection** like:

  | Entity Type      | Example                                         |
