# Optimize model performance

explore how you can use prompt engineering techniques to optimize your model's performance.

## Apply prompt patterns to optimize your model's output

some patterns that help you improve the output of a model:

- Instruct the model to act as a persona.
- Guide the model to suggest better questions.
- Provide a template to generate output in a specific format.
- Understand how a model reasons by asking it to reflect.
- Add context to improve the accuracy of the model's output.
