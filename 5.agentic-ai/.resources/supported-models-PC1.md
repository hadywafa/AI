# 👨‍💻 Since you're using a **NVIDIA Quadro K2100M** (CUDA 3.0, 2GB VRAM)

you're very limited in what you can run **locally** due to:

- ❌ Outdated architecture (Kepler)
- ❌ No FP16/INT8/8-bit quantization
- ❌ Only 2GB VRAM (too little for almost all modern LLMs)

---

## ✅ Models That _Can_ Work on Quadro 2100 (or on CPU)

These models are **lightweight**, usually <500MB–1.5GB total, and **still provide decent NLP functionality** for basic tasks like summarization, classification, and small-scale generation.

---

### 🥇 1. **`google/flan-t5-small`**

- ✅ **Works on CPU or Quadro 2100**
- Type: Seq2Seq
- Tasks: Summarization, translation, QA, instruction following
- Size: ~250MB

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer, pipeline

model_id = "google/flan-t5-small"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_id)

pipe = pipeline("text2text-generation", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, device=-1)  # CPU
print(pipe("Translate English to French: How are you?"))
```

---

### 🥈 2. **`tiiuae/falcon-rw-1b`**

- 🧠 Light LLM from Falcon project
- Size: ~2.5GB → Try it on CPU only if you have **≥ 8GB system RAM**
- Tasks: Causal LM

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, pipeline

model_id = "tiiuae/falcon-rw-1b"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id)

pipe = pipeline("text-generation", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, device=-1)
print(pipe("Once upon a time", max_new_tokens=50))
```

---

### 🥉 3. **`sshleifer/tiny-gpt2`**

- 🔬 Tiny version of GPT-2 for demo/testing
- Size: ~100MB!
- Great for **learning or debugging** on any hardware

```python
from transformers import pipeline
pipe = pipeline("text-generation", model="sshleifer/tiny-gpt2", device=-1)
print(pipe("The quick brown fox", max_new_tokens=30))
```

---

### 🪄 4. **`distilbert-base-uncased`** (for NLP tasks like sentiment, NER, etc.)

- Not a generator, but **great for classification tasks**
- Runs easily on CPU or Quadro 2100

```python
from transformers import pipeline
pipe = pipeline("sentiment-analysis", model="distilbert-base-uncased", device=-1)
print(pipe("I love LangChain and Transformers!"))
```

---

## 🔥 BONUS: Use These Models with LangChain

You can wrap them like this:

```python
from langchain.llms import HuggingFacePipeline
llm = HuggingFacePipeline(pipeline=pipe)
print(llm.invoke("Tell me a story about a penguin."))
```

## ❗ What NOT to Run on Quadro 2100

| ❌ Models to Avoid | Reason                 |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| LLaMA (all sizes)  | Needs FP16 + 8GB VRAM+ |
| Mistral            | Too large              |
| DeepSeek-R1        | Requires FP8 GPU       |
| GPT-NeoX, Mixtral  | Too big                |

---

## ✅ TL;DR – Best Models for Quadro 2100

| Model                     | Type        | Good For                        | Works on      |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `google/flan-t5-small`    | Instruction | Summarization, Q&A, translation | ✅ CPU / 2100 |
| `tiiuae/falcon-rw-1b`     | LLM         | Story generation                | ⚠️ CPU only   |
| `sshleifer/tiny-gpt2`     | Tiny GPT    | Fast test gen                   | ✅ Everywhere |
| `distilbert-base-uncased` | BERT        | Classification                  | ✅ Everywhere |

Want me to bundle this in a full **Google Colab or script** to test them all on your current hardware? Or give you a LangChain-ready wrapper for these? I'm happy to help 💡
