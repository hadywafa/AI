# üîç How Google Colab Gives You GPU Access for Free

Google Colab is a free service by Google to encourage learning, prototyping, and education with Python and machine learning tools. To support that:

- They let you use **NVIDIA T4 GPUs (16GB VRAM)** or sometimes **P100 (16GB)** or **K80 (12GB)**.
- The free tier is **time-limited** and **resource-constrained** so you don‚Äôt abuse it.

They do this because:

- It helps build a community around TensorFlow and JAX.
- It converts serious users into **Colab Pro** or **GCP paying customers**.

## üí° Google Colab (Free) ‚Äì Limitations

| Resource        | Limit                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| GPU Type        | Usually **T4** (sometimes K80 or P100)  |
| Max Runtime     | ~12 hours (or less if idle)             |
| Daily Usage     | **Up to ~12‚Äì24 hours** per day (varies) |
| Session Length  | 90 mins (auto disconnect if idle)       |
| Concurrent GPUs | **1 active session only**               |
| Compute Units   | Invisible credits that throttle usage   |

‚ö†Ô∏è If you run too many sessions per day, your next session will be **CPU-only** until your quota resets.

## üíé Google Colab Pro / Pro+ (Paid Tiers)

| Tier           | Price       | Benefits                                    |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Pro**        | ~\$10/month | More T4 time, longer sessions, less queue   |
| **Pro+**       | ~\$50/month | Occasional access to **A100**, higher quota |
| **Enterprise** | \$\$\$      | Reserved GPUs, SLAs, support                |

## ‚úÖ What You Can Do on Free Tier

With the **T4 GPU**, you can comfortably:

- Run **LangChain** with OpenAI or HuggingFace API models
- Fine-tune small models (e.g., LoRA on 1.3B or 2.7B models)
- Run **FAISS**, RAG, and **CrewAI** locally
- Use it for **LangGraph**, multi-agent tests, and pipelines

You can‚Äôt:

- Run full **7B+ models** natively unless quantized
- Host your model persistently
- Train large transformer models from scratch

## üß† TL;DR

| Colab Tier | GPU Access  | Session Time | Usage Quota | Ideal For                        |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| Free       | T4 / K80    | ~12 hrs/day  | Limited     | Learning, agents, testing        |
| Pro        | T4 priority | ~24 hrs/day  | Higher      | Real dev, RAG, multi-agent apps  |
| Pro+       | A100+       | Long & fast  | Best quota  | Finetuning, research, deployment |

## üöÄ Bonus Tip

You can run **`!nvidia-smi`** in a Colab cell to check which GPU you got:

```python
!nvidia-smi
```

Let me know if you want me to:

- Optimize your Colab runtime usage
- Set up a **LangChain starter notebook** with OpenAI + FAISS + CrewAI
- Track and auto-reconnect sessions to avoid idle cuts
